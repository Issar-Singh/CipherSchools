In this session, we'll identify the fundamental knowledge and resources that any data scientist should be familiar with. We'll go over machine learning frameworks, software tools for data visualization and manipulation, and programming languages like R and Python. Gaining a knowledge of these fundamental skills will equip us to handle data science problems in the real world.
